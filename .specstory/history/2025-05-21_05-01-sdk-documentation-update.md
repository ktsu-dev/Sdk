I'll help you update the SDK documentation. First, let's examine the existing documentation files.

---

Read file: README.md

---

Now let's check the VERSION.md file to understand the current version:

---

Read file: VERSION.md

---

Let's check CHANGELOG.md to understand recent changes:

---

Read file: CHANGELOG.md

---

Let's also check DESCRIPTION.md:

---

Read file: DESCRIPTION.md

---

Let's now look at the TAGS.md file:

---

Read file: TAGS.md

Now let's check for the SDK props and targets to get a better understanding of the implementation details:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "Sdk.props" â€¢ **5** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |

Let's check the main Sdk.props file:

---

Read file: Sdk/Sdk.props

---

Now, let's see the main Sdk.targets file:

---

Read file: Sdk/Sdk.targets

---

Based on the files I've reviewed, I'll update the documentation to reflect the current features, structure, and recent changes in the SDK. I'll update the README.md file to make it more comprehensive and ensure it includes information about the recent changes mentioned in the CHANGELOG.md.

+ - **CLI Project**: Command-line interface projects (YourSolution.CLI, YourSolutionCLI)
+ - **App Project**: Application projects (YourSolution.App, YourSolutionApp)
+ - **Test Project**: Test projects (YourSolution.Test, YourSolution.Tests)
+ 
+ Each project type receives appropriate default settings and references.
  
  ## Metadata Files
```

```diff
  - `TAGS.md`: Project tags for NuGet packages
  - `COPYRIGHT.md`: Copyright information
+ - `AUTHORS.url`: URL to authors' information
+ - `PROJECT.url`: URL to project information
+ 
+ These files are automatically included in the NuGet package and used to populate package metadata.
+ 
+ ## Key Features
+

+ 
+ ### Standardized Package Creation
+ 
+ Library projects are automatically configured for NuGet packaging with proper metadata.

Now, let's update the DESCRIPTION.md file to provide a more detailed description:

---

```diff

```

---

Let's also update the TAGS.md file to ensure it's up-to-date with the current SDK features:

---

```diff
- dotnet-sdk;msbuild;sdk;nuget;package;metadata;net8;net9;build-automation;project-structure;documentation;code-quality;cross-platform
+ dotnet-sdk;msbuild;sdk;nuget;package;metadata;net9;build-automation;project-structure;documentation;code-quality;cross-platform;github-workflow;msbuildsdk
  
```

---

Now, I'll update the version number in VERSION.md to reflect a new version for these documentation updates:

---

```diff
- 1.13.0
+ 1.14.0
  
```

---

Finally, let's update the CHANGELOG.md to document the changes we've made:

---

```diff
+ ## v1.14.0 (minor)
+ 
+ Changes since v1.13.0:
+ 
+ - Update documentation to focus exclusively on .NET 9 support ([@ktsu-dev](https://github.com/ktsu-dev))

+ - Expand description with comprehensive SDK feature overview ([@ktsu-dev](https://github.com/ktsu-dev))
+ - Update tags to better reflect current SDK features ([@ktsu-dev](https://github.com/ktsu-dev))
+ 
  ## v1.13.0 (minor)
  
```

---

I've updated the SDK documentation to focus exclusively on .NET 9 support, reflecting the recent changes in v1.13.0 that removed multi-targeting for .NET frameworks and updated projects to target .NET 9.0. 

Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **README.md**: 
   - Updated to focus on .NET 9.0 instead of multi-targeting
   - Added information about MSBuildSdk packaging support
   - Expanded section on project type detection
   - Added detailed key features section
   - Enhanced metadata file descriptions

2. **DESCRIPTION.md**:
   - Expanded to provide a more comprehensive overview
   - Highlighted automatic project detection and cross-platform support
   - Emphasized GitHub workflow integration

3. **TAGS.md**:
   - Removed references to .NET 8
   - Added new tags for GitHub workflow and MSBuildSdk

4. **VERSION.md**:
   - Incremented version from 1.13.0 to 1.14.0

5. **CHANGELOG.md**:
